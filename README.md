# Ardunio

The Arduino package is collection of my Arduino projects that do ''not'' use/depend on the Arduino IDE for building and downloading HEX files.

Documentation is located in the top/ directory and/or availabe at: www.integerfox.com/arduino.

To build/use Arduino within the Outcast model - see the installation instrucation at: www.integerfox.com/outcast/start_here.html#Installing
 
Arduino is licensed with a BSD licensing agreement (see the top/ directory).
